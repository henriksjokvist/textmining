Implementation of the algorithm from http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-228536

In order to run the algorithm, download a pre-trained fastText word embedding model and place in the /word_embeddings folder. In the thesis the Swedish .bin embeddings from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html were used.

Place input data in the /data folder. Ensure that data is a csv file with the text string in the first column and an ID number in the second.
